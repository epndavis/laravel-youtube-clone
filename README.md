# Laravel Youtube Clone

This is a project built to practice a variety of programming and designs. These include:
1) Buidling an api and user auth system in Laravel
2) Creating a single page application (SPA)
3) Processing user uploaded data including files
4) Utilising the vue framework to build an interactive app
5) Programming as a test driven development (TDD)
6) Buliding custom javascript libraries 

The end goal is to build a youtube clone/replica (not for commerical use) using the processes listed above. This way I have a design which contains certain problems that will be challenging and best test my skills.
